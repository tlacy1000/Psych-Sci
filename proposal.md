Psych-sci is an (unofficial) app created for the 1st annual psychedelic science summit in Austin, TX. It provides information about scheduled research talks, gives users the ability to add info about their own talk, provides speaker bios, resources for scientists to reference, gives a map of the conference area, and a recommendation list of things to do while in the area. There is also a user signup/login feature where users will be able to favorite research talks they're interested in, and add their own talks to the database.

What need does this solve? 
Conference apps are a great way to demonstrate real life applications to employers. Every conference needs a central source of information, and the abilities to do important time management tasks such as prioritize certain workshops or add in events.

What makes this app different or memorable? 
By its very nature, this is a controversial app. Psychedelics research is still widely considered taboo, even within the scientific community. Since the federal criminalization act of 1968, LSD research was haulted, including (but not limited to) its applications in psychotherapy for treating a multitude of illnesses. By creating the companion app to the summit, I am supporting psychedelic research and furthering its cause by making it more accessible to greater amounts of people, while displaying the recent accolades the work done by this organization has achieved.
