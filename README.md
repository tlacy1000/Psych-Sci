# Psych-Sci
Psych-sci is an (unofficial) app created for the 1st annual psychedelic science summit in Austin, TX. It provides information about scheduled research talks, gives users the ability to add info about their own talk, provides speaker bios, resources for scientists to reference, gives a map of the conference area, and a recommendation list of things to do while in the area. There is also a user signup/login feature where users will be able to favorite research talks they're interested in, and add their own talks to the database.

## General info
As a former neuroscientist, science conferences are near and dear to my heart! I'm passionate about the efficacy of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. MAPS, the organization that hosts the Psychedelic Science Summit, is the sponsor of the first publication I ever read that piqued my interest in neuroscience. I am forever grateful to MAPS and its affiliates who continue to trailblaze the future of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy and hope that we may soon see a day where psychedelics are legalized for the medical treatment of PTSD.
