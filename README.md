Psych-sci is an (unofficial) app created for the 1st annual psychedelic science summit in Austin, TX. It provides information about scheduled research talks, provides speaker info, resources for scientists to reference, gives a map of the conference area, and a recommendation list of things to do while in the area. There is also a user signup/login feature where users will be able to favorite research talks they're interested in, and add their own resources to the database.
